Cucumber is an open source tool that supports Behavior Driven Development (BDD) framework.
It provides the facility to write tests in a human readable language called Gherkin. 

###PreRequisites :
1.setup JDK on your system
2.Install Eclipse
3.Install Cucumber
	In Eclipse, go to Help → Install new software
	On the Available Software popup, enter the URL “http://cucumber.github.com/cucumber-eclipse/update-site” in the Work with field.
4.Setup Maven project. https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi
5.Add dependency for Selenium and Cucumber in "pom.xml". Refer to https://mvnrepository.com/

###Implementation:
1.Create the feature file
2.Create Testrunner class inorder to execute the feature file.
3.Create step definition files [ in my program step definitions are under SeleniumCode package]

###Execution:
To execute the code, right click test.feature file → Run As → Cucumber feature

###Create HTML Reports using Extent-Reports:
1.Add dependencies which are 
	Cucumber-extentsreport
	extentreports
2.Add config.xml file
3.Modify testrunner class

###Command line execution:
Open the terminal in your system and navigate to your project directory.
Since we have already added a Maven dependency through pom.xml, we can execute the test using the simple command mvn test. 
In case you have a large number of feature files added to your project, 
and you only want to execute one file, 
you can use the command mvn test -Dcucumber.options=”src/test/java/Features/filename.feature.
